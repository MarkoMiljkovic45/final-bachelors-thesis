# Visualization of substation OT elements described using SCL language
## Abstract
Substations are a key part of the power system and their configuration and architecture are critical for the safe and reliable delivery of electricity to households. This paper focuses on the IEC 61850 standard, which simplified the design and configuration of substations. IEC 61850 unifies data models and communication protocols in substations and thus enables the interoperability of devices between different manufacturers. Also, along with this work, a visualizer of configuration files written in SCL language defined by the IEC 61850 standard was implemented.
